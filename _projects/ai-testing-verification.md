title: AI Testing & Verification

description: |
  Neural networks can be (arguably) viewed a different paradigm of programming, where logical reasoning is replaced with big data and optimization. Unlike traditional programs, however, neural networks are subject to bugs, e.g., adversarial samples and discriminatory instances. In this line of work, we aim to develop systematic theories, methods and tools to improve the quality of AI-systems.
